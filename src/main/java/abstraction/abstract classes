An abstract class is a class which cannot be instantiated.
An abstract class is used by creating an inheriting subclass that can be instantiated.

An abstract class does a few things for the inheriting subclass:

- Define methods which can be used by the inheriting subclass.
- Define abstract methods which the inheriting subclass must implement.
- Provide a common interface which allows the subclass to be interchanged with all other subclasses.
