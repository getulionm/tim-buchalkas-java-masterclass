Difference between abstract classes and interfaces:

- Abstract class can have member variables that are inherited
    - Can't be done for interface

- All interface variables are public static final (constant values [never change] and have static scope)
    - Non-static variables require instances, Interfaces cannot be instantiated

    "Interface variables are static because Java interfaces cannot be instantiated in their own right; the value of
    the variable must be assigned in a static context in which no instance exists. The final modifier ensures the
    value assigned to the interface variable is a true constant that cannot be re-assigned by program code."

- Interfaces cannot have constructors
    - Abstract classes can

- All methods of an Interface are public abstract
    - methods of an Abstract class can have any visibility and can have implementation

- Abstract classes can have defined methods (with an implementation)
    - All methods in an Interface are abstract (code has to be written in the class that implements the interface)
